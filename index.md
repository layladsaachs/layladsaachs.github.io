### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

	Lab 4, part 1 was a favorite because I thought that the unit conversion through code was very interesting. The fact that we were able to code something that could do quick calculations for us really helped open the door to the possibilities of what I was capable of doing with code. This was an earlier lab but it was the gateway to opening my eyes to my abilities.

* Lab 6

	Lab 6, part 2 was a favorite because this lab was the first lab we really got into if statements and using them effectively. Being a blackjack lover, this lab really interested me because it was basically coding a game. I never thought I would be able to simply code a game as easily as I did in this lab!.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1 was a favorite because this was another lab that seemed very complex on the outside but after being able to apply my notes I saw it come together very seamlessly. This lab worked with score averages and I felt very proud of myself to create something that could use an input effectively.
